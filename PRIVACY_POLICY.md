# Privacy Policy

I use Google Analytics and Hotjar as third party tracking services on Luan Orlandi website, but I don’t use them to track you individually or collect your User Personal Information.

I use Google Analytics to collect information about how my website performs and how my users, in general, navigate through and use my website. Google Analytics gathers certain simple, non-personally identifying information over time, such as your IP address, browser type, internet service provider, referring and exit pages, time stamp, and similar data about your usage of my website.

I use Hotjar to collect clicks areas and heatmaps to detect what is intereting for the users and what is not interesting.

These data helps me evaluate my users' use; compile statistical reports on activity; and improve my content and website performance.

I do not link or sell any information related to your personal information such as your user name.
